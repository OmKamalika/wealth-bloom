**Missing Mathematical Foundations:**
```python
# Example: Actual Wealth Trajectory Model (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
class WealthTrajectoryModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # These need actual research-backed parameters
        self.income_growth_model = GeometricBrownianMotion(
            drift=0.03,  # Based on what data?
            volatility=0.15,  # Industry validated?
            correlation_matrix={}  # How computed?
        )
        
        self.expense_inflation_model = MeanRevertingProcess(
            long_term_mean=0.035,  # Empirically validated?
            reversion_speed=0.1,  # Academic source?
            volatility=0.08  # Historical analysis?
        )
        
        # Parent care cost modeling (COMPLETELY MISSING)
        self.parent_care_model = ParentCareStochasticModel(
            onset_probability_by_age={},  # Needs actuarial data
            cost_escalation_rate=0.055,  # Healthcare inflation
            duration_distribution={},  # Life expectancy tables
            quality_of_care_premium={}  # Regional variations
        )
```
