## Critical Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2: Core calculation engine must be accurate
Phase 2 → Phase 3: Viral mechanisms must be working
Phase 3 → Phase 4: User engagement must be proven
```

### Business Risk Mitigation
- **Competition**: Build content moat and category ownership early
- **Regulation**: Conservative disclaimers and legal review in Phase 1
- **User Trust**: Transparent methodology and data sources
- **Technical Debt**: Planned refactoring between phases

### Resource Requirements by Phase

| Phase | Duration | Team Size | Budget | Cumulative Investment |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| 1     | 4 months | 3 devs    | $150K  | $150K             |
| 2     | 4 months | 4 devs    | $200K  | $350K             |
| 3     | 5 months | 5 devs    | $300K  | $650K             |
| 4     | 6 months | 5 devs    | $250K  | $900K             |

### Decision Points Between Phases

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**: 
- ✅ User feedback confirms emotional impact
- ✅ Calculation accuracy feels credible
- ✅ Email capture rate >10%
- ✅ Initial media coverage achieved

**Phase 2 → Phase 3**:
- ✅ Viral coefficient >0.5
- ✅ Monthly users >10K
- ✅ Mobile experience is polished
- ✅ Revenue model validated

**Phase 3 → Phase 4**:
- ✅ Daily active users >1K
- ✅ Retention rates support engagement claims
- ✅ Clear path to monetization
- ✅ Advisor interest confirmed

## Alternative: Lean Validation Approach

If $150K Phase 1 budget is too high, consider:

### Ultra-Lean Validation (1 month, $15K)
- Google Forms for inputs
- Google Sheets for calculations
- Manual result emails
- Simple landing page
- **Goal**: 100 users, validate core hypothesis

### Minimal Viable Product (2 months, $50K)
- Static calculator with client-side calculation
- Basic email capture
- Simple results visualization
- No user accounts or persistence
- **Goal**: 1,000 users, prove concept

### Growth MVP (3 months, $100K)
- Enhanced calculation accuracy
- Social sharing functionality
- Email automation
- Mobile optimization
- **Goal**: 5,000 users, early traction

## Recommendation

**Start with Ultra-Lean Validation**:
1. Prove the emotional impact with manual processes
2. Validate calculation credibility with target users
3. Test sharing willingness and viral potential
4. Use learning to refine full development plan

**Only proceed to Phase 1 full development after proving**:
- Users complete the full input process
- Results generate emotional response
- Users share and recommend to others
- Clear demand for automated/enhanced version

The full "unicorn" vision is compelling but represents significant technical and business risk. Validating core assumptions first will help you build the right product and avoid over-engineering.
