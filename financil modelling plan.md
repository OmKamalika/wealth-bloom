# Financial Modeling Implementation Requirements

## 1. Mathematical Model Validation (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### Current Status: Conceptual Framework Only
The plan mentions "247 variables" and "Monte Carlo simulation" but lacks:

**Missing Mathematical Foundations:**
```python
# Example: Actual Wealth Trajectory Model (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
class WealthTrajectoryModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # These need actual research-backed parameters
        self.income_growth_model = GeometricBrownianMotion(
            drift=0.03,  # Based on what data?
            volatility=0.15,  # Industry validated?
            correlation_matrix={}  # How computed?
        )
        
        self.expense_inflation_model = MeanRevertingProcess(
            long_term_mean=0.035,  # Empirically validated?
            reversion_speed=0.1,  # Academic source?
            volatility=0.08  # Historical analysis?
        )
        
        # Parent care cost modeling (COMPLETELY MISSING)
        self.parent_care_model = ParentCareStochasticModel(
            onset_probability_by_age={},  # Needs actuarial data
            cost_escalation_rate=0.055,  # Healthcare inflation
            duration_distribution={},  # Life expectancy tables
            quality_of_care_premium={}  # Regional variations
        )
```

## 2. Required Research and Validation Work

### Academic Research Requirements (6-8 weeks)
**Status**: Not Started

**Required Research:**
- [ ] **Actuarial Analysis**: Life expectancy, health transition probabilities
- [ ] **Healthcare Cost Modeling**: Regional variations, inflation patterns
- [ ] **Education Cost Projections**: Institution-specific, inflation-adjusted
- [ ] **Wealth Transfer Statistics**: Estate planning effectiveness data
- [ ] **Behavioral Finance Parameters**: Risk tolerance, decision-making patterns

### Data Partnership Requirements
**Status**: Identified vendors, no agreements

**Critical Data Sources:**
```typescript
interface DataRequirements {
  actuarialData: {
    provider: "Society of Actuaries" | "SSA Life Tables";
    cost: "$15K-50K annually";
    coverage: "Life expectancy, disability, long-term care";
    integration: "API + annual updates";
  };
  
  marketData: {
    provider: "Bloomberg Terminal" | "Refinitiv";
    cost: "$24K annually per terminal";
    coverage: "Real-time market data, historical analysis";
    integration: "REST API + WebSocket";
  };
  
  healthcareData: {
    provider: "CMS" | "Healthcare Cost Institute";
    cost: "Free (government) + processing costs";
    coverage: "Regional healthcare costs, trend analysis";
    integration: "Bulk download + processing";
  };
}
```

## 3. Model Calibration and Backtesting Framework

### Validation Strategy (MISSING)
**Required Components:**
- [ ] **Historical Backtesting**: Test model against 20+ years family wealth data
- [ ] **Peer Review**: Academic validation of methodologies
- [ ] **Stress Testing**: Model performance under extreme scenarios
- [ ] **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter uncertainty quantification

### Model Performance Benchmarks
**Current Status**: No benchmarks defined

**Required Accuracy Targets:**
```typescript
interface ModelAccuracyTargets {
  wealthProjection: {
    timeHorizon: "10-year, 20-year, 30-year";
    accuracyTarget: "±15% for 10-year, ±25% for 20-year";
    confidenceInterval: "80% of predictions within range";
  };
  
  parentCareCosts: {
    onsetPrediction: "±2 years accuracy target";
    costPrediction: "±20% of actual costs";
    durationPrediction: "±30% of actual duration";
  };
  
  educationCosts: {
    costPrediction: "±10% of actual college costs";
    inflationTracking: "±5% of education inflation";
  };
}
```

## 4. Real-Time Calculation Architecture

### Performance Requirements (PARTIALLY DEFINED)
**Current Gaps:**
- No specific latency requirements for different calculation types
- No caching strategy for common scenarios
- No approximation algorithms for real-time responses

**Required Performance Architecture:**
```typescript
interface CalculationPerformance {
  realTimeRequirements: {
    simpleCalculation: "<500ms (basic scenario)";
    complexCalculation: "<3s (full Monte Carlo)";
    recalculation: "<1s (parameter change)";
    batchProcessing: "<30s (pre-computation)";
  };
  
  cachingStrategy: {
    commonScenarios: "Redis cache, 1-hour TTL";
    userSessions: "Browser localStorage + server backup";
    precomputedResults: "CDN edge cache, daily refresh";
  };
  
  approximationMethods: {
    fastEstimation: "Polynomial approximation for real-time";
    progressiveRefinement: "Quick estimate → detailed calculation";
    adaptiveComplexity: "Complexity based on user profile";
  };
}
```

## 5. Financial Model Compliance and Disclaimers

### Legal and Regulatory Framework (NOT ADDRESSED)
**Critical Missing Elements:**
- [ ] **Fiduciary Disclaimer**: Not providing investment advice
- [ ] **Model Limitations**: Uncertainty and assumption disclosure
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance**: SEC, FINRA guidance on calculators
- [ ] **Professional Review**: CFP/CFA validation of methodologies

### Required Legal Documentation:
```markdown
## Model Disclaimer Framework (NEEDS LEGAL REVIEW)

### Calculation Limitations
- Projections based on historical data and statistical models
- Actual results may vary significantly from projections
- Models cannot predict black swan events or unprecedented scenarios
- Regular model updates required as economic conditions change

### Professional Advice Disclaimer
- Calculator provides educational estimates only
- Not a substitute for professional financial planning
- Users should consult qualified financial advisors
- Individual circumstances may require specialized analysis
```

## 6. Quality Assurance and Testing Framework

### Model Testing Strategy (UNDEFINED)
**Required Testing Types:**
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Individual model components
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Model interaction validation
- [ ] **Scenario Testing**: Edge case and extreme scenario validation
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Calculation speed and accuracy trade-offs
- [ ] **User Testing**: Result credibility and understanding

### Continuous Model Improvement
**Framework Needed:**
```typescript
interface ModelImprovement {
  feedbackLoop: {
    userFeedback: "Result credibility surveys";
    expertReview: "Professional advisor validation";
    outcomeTracking: "Actual vs predicted comparison";
  };
  
  modelUpdating: {
    parameterRefreshSchedule: "Quarterly for market data, annually for demographic";
    modelVersioning: "Backward compatibility for historical calculations";
    a11yTesting: "Result interpretation across user sophistication levels";
  };
}
```
