```python
def calculate_wealth_extinction(inputs):
    # Base wealth trajectory
    starting_wealth = inputs.net_worth
    annual_income_growth = 0.03  # Conservative
    annual_spending_growth = 0.035  # Slightly above income
    investment_return = 0.05  # Conservative portfolio
    
    # Sandwich generation modifiers
    parent_care_shock = calculate_parent_care_costs(inputs.parent_status)
    education_costs = calculate_education_trajectory(inputs.children_education)
    lifestyle_inflation = calculate_lifestyle_creep(inputs.income_level)
    
    # Generational wealth transfer
    inheritance_tax_impact = calculate_estate_taxes(inputs.state)
    next_gen_financial_literacy = 0.3  # 70% lose wealth due to poor management
    asset_fragmentation_loss = 0.15  # Legal fees, family disputes
    
    # Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations)
    scenarios = run_wealth_simulation(
        base_params=base_trajectory,
        risk_factors=[parent_care_shock, education_costs, lifestyle_inflation],
        generational_transfers=[inheritance_tax_impact, financial_literacy, fragmentation],
        generations=3
    )
    
    return {
        'extinction_year': median_extinction_year,
        'confidence_interval': (p25_extinction, p75_extinction),
        'primary_causes': ranked_wealth_destroyers,

    }
```
